> "Some people want to leave a mark. I just want to make sure mine reaches orbit."

Hey, I’m Elliot Briant — aka *the_social_hacker* — a software engineer with a background in full-stack development, AI integration, and space innovation. My work lies at the intersection of code, science, and community impact. 

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a Brazilian-American dev with one foot in the command line, one foot on the launchpad, and my head somewhere in low Earth orbit. I write code to solve real problems and imagine a better future — ideally one with less gravity and more collaboration.

## 🛠️ What I do when I'm not debugging reality:

- 🧠 **AI Whisperer**: Fine-tuned LLaMA models, dissected OpenAI’s JSON dreams, and made resumes confess their secrets.
- 💻 **Full-Stack Wizardry**: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, ColdFusion (yes, still breathing), and some TypeScript spells.
- 🛰️ **Space Tech Enthusiast**: Participated in analog astronaut missions, launched experiments into microgravity, and help select humans to go *up there*.
- 🧬 **Biohacking Research**: Turning proteins, genes, and muscle degeneration into code and companies. FDA approval pending, but vibes are good.
- 🎤 **Public Speaker & Storyteller**: Because good code should come with a narrative arc.
- 🐱‍👤 **Startup Survivor**: Ex-CEO, current everything-else. Built fintech, web3, and social platforms with Wi-Fi and caffeine.

## 💡 About Me

I’m passionate about creating meaningful solutions that bridge today’s challenges with tomorrow’s possibilities — whether it’s through scalable web applications, intelligent automation, or scientific research in microgravity environments.

- 🛰️ **Space & Research**  
  Participated in analog astronaut missions and microgravity-focused research, contributing to experiments on musculoskeletal degeneration and protein folding in space. I advocate for democratizing access to space and am actively involved in space outreach programs such as MoonDAO and TODXS.

- 👨‍💻 **Engineering & Product**  
  I've led full-stack development for fintech, music-tech, and AI SaaS platforms. My stack includes React, Node.js, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, TypeScript, Golang, Python, and yes — ColdFusion (legacy systems matter too).

- 🤖 **AI + Automation**  
  Designed intelligent pipelines for resume parsing, file extraction (PDF/DOCX/OCR), and built conversational agents powered by OpenAI and LLaMA. I believe good automation saves time — and bad automation makes great debugging stories.

- 🌍 **Advocacy & Impact**  
  As an ambassador for inclusion and science education, I collaborate with nonprofits and student-led initiatives to make STEM and space more accessible to underrepresented communities.
